      <h3>My Projects</h3>
      <p>
        I have done multiple learning projects with different technologies
        likeReact.js, React Native, javaScript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, BootStrap,
        Java, PHP, C++, Python, DBMS. Recetly, I have deployed{" "}
        <a href="https://khem-bookcategory.herokuapp.com/login" target="blank">
          {" "}
          Book-Category{" "}
        </a>{" "}
        application to Heroku. This app is a good use of CRUD functionality in
        Java, Spring Boot and Maven dependencies. This app is applied with Maven
        Security so that you need to login with credentials. It consists of two
        interfaces- one for user and one for admin.

        I am ative in{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/khemrajneupane" target="blank">
          GitHub
        </a>{" "}
        where my profile contains some of my projects done in Java, PHP, HTML,
        CSS, javaScript, ReactJS and React Native, Springboot etc. Another
        interesting front-end and backend project is{" "}
        <strong>Java-MariaDB</strong>,{" "}

        >
          Check ScreenShots
        </a>
        . Student object and StudentDAO are used to provide CRUD transactions to
        find student by id, delete by id, find all students, insert new stuents
        values, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another useable application is{" "}
        <a
          href="https://khem-fitnessclub-db.herokuapp.com/customers"
          target="blank"
        >
          Personal-Trainer
        </a>
        , which deletes, updates, inserts, lists customers and their trainings
        from the RESTful api, has been deployed in Heroku, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have created my first learning phase application- even before starting
        formal IT degree{" "}
        <q>
          <a
            href="http://myy.haaga-helia.fi/~a1800727/myProjects/weatherAPP/"

          >
            Weather APP
          </a>
        </q>
        using Open Weather API, and front-end tools where the APP displays
        current weather of the current place and curret time, toggle effect
        between <sup>&deg;C</sup> to
        <sup>&deg;F</sup>. Based on the temperature intensity, it displays a
        relevant message, too.
      </p>

      <div className="content">
        <p>
          I have also created a mobile app named <strong>Mobile Project</strong>{" "}
          using React Native where the app contains buttons and pictures. Once
          we click a call button, it chooses a lucky phone number with its name
          and just by clicking on the name or phone number, we can call the
          lucky number. Not only that, we can also send a randomly fetched joke
          as a text message to the lucky number. Ohter features include-
          choosing pictures from phone gallery and creating own gallery inside
          the app space by saving it and viewing it. Also there is current
          location, current weather of the location and so on. For the code, you
          can visit my github projects or just give it a click-{" "}

          this app tapping Android platform there.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Currently, I am 3rd semester Software Development student at Haaga-Helia
        University of Applied Sciences. I take keen interest in doing
        programming courses. I have done many project works within this course
        that has given me lot of confidence to excell further in the information
        technology field in my future career.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a keen learner and a passionate programmer with less than a
        half-way to graduation in Business Information Technology from
        Haaga-Helia and actively looking for an internship place where from I
        expect to gain professionalism in the field of programming. My knowledge
        and skills include JavaScript, Java, Python,C++, PHP, CSS, HTML5,
        ReactJS, ReactNative, etc.

          Before I started this course in 2017, I prepared myself with all the
          basics of programming skills and knowledge needed to become a good
          learner. It took me some 6 months to acheive this goal. This is why,
          today, I find it easy to understand the programming logics and
          algorithms.

      <h3>My Strengths</h3>
      <p>
        I am a passionate learner and industrious programmer. Programming,
        without which I cannot find interest in many other things to develop my
        future career, has become an indespensable part of my everyday life.
        With all my programmin knowledge, I believe I will find a good working
        place from where I can not only draw my professional line but also I can
        be an important part for the company's well-being.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can assure that the business and managerial knowledge I have gained so
        far from <b>International Business Program</b> along with my programming
        and software development strength gained from{" "}
        <b>Business Information Technology Program </b>will definitely bring a
        successful result for any company that I will work in in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to mention, my former graduation majoring in English and Economics
        can be crucial aspects to mainain strong and deplomatic relationship
        with companies, partners, stakeholders, customers where, most
        importantly, cross-cultural communication with astute, independent
        decision-making skills are required.
